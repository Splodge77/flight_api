# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start`

---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

### As is noted in the comments, I would add function that finds all the necessary information to be displayed in the front end just by searching for the 'leg', as opposed to writing many functions for many purposes

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
### Sorting a problem using an undefined catch, which is something that I generally wouldn't do. The runtime error still exists but at least I was able to get on with some more work instead of going around in tight circles.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
### Debugging the axios request which was behaving very differently from the time I've used it before.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
### Overall I enjoyed the test, was frustrated that I didn't finish but felt that it was fair for this particular level.
